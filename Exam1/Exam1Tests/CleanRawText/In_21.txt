in quantum computing, a qubit (short for quantum bit) is a unit of quantum informationsimilar to a classical bit. Where classical bits hold a single binary value such as a 0 or 1, a qubit can hold both values at the same time in what's known as a superposition state. When multiple qubits act coherently, they can process multiple options simultaneously. This allows them to process information in a fraction of the time it would take even the fastest nonquantum systems.Where current computers would require tens of billions of years to solve some of the worlds most challenging problems, a quantum computer would be able to find a solution in only minutes, hours, or days. Quantum computing will enable researchers to simulate and develop new catalysts and materials, improve medicines, accelerate advances in artificial intelligence, and even answer fundamental questions about the origins of our universe.Qubits are highly fragile, and any outside disturbance can cause the quantum state to collapse. With this common challenge, the best way to scale a quantum computer is by using a more stable type of qubitone with more resistance to disturbances. A topological qubit provides this stability, storing information much like a knot on a string. Regardless of what happens to the string, the knot remains. Quantum computers with topological qubits will have a more solid foundation and the ability to scale at a much higher rate.
